### Getting Started with Angular Libraries - Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Angular libraries! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating and using Angular libraries. Whether you're a beginner or just looking for a quick refresher, this guide is designed to help you get started.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
  - Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)

## Part 1: Creating a New Angular Project - 13th-January-2024

1. **Create a New Angular Project**

- Go to the [Angular official guide](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries) for more details.
- Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new project without app folders:
  ```bash
  ng new <project-name> --no-create-application
  ```
  This command generates a project with essential files like `package.json` and `angular.json`.

- **Notes**:
  - `package.json` contains scripts and dependencies for your project.
  - You can add and configure npm scripts in the `scripts` section.

2. **Generate a Library Component**

- Navigate to the project directory you just created.
- Run this command to generate a library component inside the `projects` folder:
  ```bash
  ng g library <library-name>
  ```
- **Notes**:
  - This command adds `ng-packagr` to your `package.json`, which is used for packaging the library.
  - The `angular.json` file is updated to include the new library under the `projects` section with `projectType` set to 'library'.

## Part 2: Using the Library in a New Angular Project

1. **Create a New Angular Project for Your Application**

- In a different directory, create a new Angular project:
  ```bash
  ng new <project-name>
  ```

2. **Add Angular Material (Optional)**

- If you want to use Angular Material, run this command to add it to your project:
  ```bash
  ng add @angular/material
  ```

3. **Build the Library**

- Back in your library project, build the library using this command:
  ```bash
  ng build <library-name> --configuration development
  ```
  This uses the development configuration specified in `angular.json` for the library.

4. **Pack the Library**

- Navigate to the <library-name> in the `dist` folder within your library project.
- Pack the library using npm:
  ```bash
  cd dist/<library-name>
  npm pack
  ```
  This creates a .tgz file that you can use to install the library in your application.

5. **Install the Library in Your Application**

- Copy the file path of the .tgz file created in the previous step.
- Run this command in your Angular application directory to install the library:
  ```bash
  npm i <dist-tgz-file-path>
  ```

## Part 3: Using a Component from the Library in Your Application

1. **Update ngModules**

- Get the module name from your library and add it to the import section of your application's module.

- **Notes**:
  - Ensure that the import points to the library and not a relative path (e.g., "../../path").

2. **Use the Library Component**

- In your parent component's HTML file, use the library component by its selector or tag-name.

## Part 4: Personal Notes - Routing

- **Creating a New Route**
  - In your application's `AppRoutingModule`, add the following route to the `routes` array:
    ```javascript
    { path: '', component: HelloComponent }
    ```
    This will route to the `HelloComponent` when no path is specified (e.g., http://localhost:4200).

- **Displaying the Component**
  - To display the component, use `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` wherever needed in your application.

## Part 5: Using Created Component from Library in Project - 14-January-24

- **Creating a New Component in Your Library**

1. Navigate to the library's 'lib' folder.
    ```
    cd projects/<library-name>/src/lib
    ```
2. Generate a new component within your library.
   ```
   ng g c <component-name>
   ```

- **Updating Library Exports and Modules**

1. Add the newly created component to the exports in the 'public-api.ts' file
2. Update the ngModule exports section in the '.module.ts' file of your library.

- **Rebuilding the Library**

1. Delete the 'dist' folder from your library.
2. Recreate the 'dist' folder by following the previous steps.
3. re-pack the library by following the previous steps to generate `.tgz` file.

- **Reinstalling the Library in Your Angular Project**

1. Delete the library from your Angular project's node_modules folder.
2. Reinstall the library in your project by following the previous installation steps.

- **Using the New Component in Your Project**

1. You can now use the newly created component from the library in your parent component's HTML by using its selector or tag name.

## Part 6: If You Encounter Errors with the New Component:

1. Delete the library from your Angular project.
2. Delete the 'dist' folder from your library.
3. Clear the cache on both the library and your project.
    ```
    npm cache clear --force
    ```
4. Change the library version and name in your library's 'package.json'.

- For example:
  - Change `"name": "your-library"` to `"name": "your-library2"`
  - Change `"version": "0.0.1"` to `"version": "0.0.2"`

5. Follow the previous steps to recreate the 'dist' folder and reinstall the library in your project.

## Part 7: Create and Use Application in Library - 16-January-24

- **Creating an Application in Your Library**

1. Navigate to your workspace directory and run the following command to create an application within your library:
    ```
    ng g application <app-name>
    ```

- **Add Angular Material to Library and Project**

1. To use Angular Material, add it to both your library and project using the following command:
    ```
    ng add @angular/material
    ```

2. Check Angular Versions in package.json

- Verify the Angular versions in your project's `package.json` file.
- Update them if necessary to ensure compatibility.

## Part 8: Watching for Changes

- **Watch for Changes to Avoid Building the Library Repeatedly**

1. Run the following command to watch for changes in your library:
    ```
    ng build <library-name> --watch --configuration development
    ```

- This command allows you to monitor changes without rebuilding the library every time you make an update.

## Part 9: Creating a Component in Your Application

- **Create a Component in Your Application**

1. Use the following command to generate a component in your application project:
    ```
    ng g c <component-name> --project=<app-name>
    ```

- Now you can use the application and library together as previously described, even with an external application.

## Part 10: Input Display - 29-January-24

- **Simultaneous Input Display**
1. To make multiple inputs appear simultaneously, ensure that you import the Browser Animation Module.

- **Grouping Text Inputs**
1. In your code, consider modifying the 'formMetaData' type as follows:
    ```typescript
    formMetaData: (RadioButtonClusterMetadata | TextInputMetadata | (RadioButtonClusterMetadata | TextInputMetadata)[])[]
    ```
    This change will allow you to group text inputs effectively.

- **Checking for Array**
1. Use the `@if` directive to check whether the 'data' variable is an array or not. You can achieve this by using the `Array.isArray()` method as a condition.

- **Iterating through an Array**
1. If the 'data' is indeed an array, utilize the `@for` directive to iterate through its elements.

---
## Part 11: Using Maps and Templates - 30-January-24

- **Creating a Map in Your Application**
1. To manage data efficiently in your Angular application, create a Map as follows:
    ```typescript
    map = new Map<string, (RadioButtonClusterMetadata | TextInputMetadata | (RadioButtonClusterMetadata | TextInputMetadata)[])[]>();
    ```
- **Utilizing the Map in Your Library**
1. Send this Map to your library and use the keys as accordion titles and the corresponding values as content for the expansion panels. This approach will help organize and display your data effectively.

- **Accessing Keys and Values from the Map**
1. To access the keys and values stored in the Map, use the following methods:
     - Use `map.keys()` to retrieve all the keys in the Map.
     - Use `map.get(key)` to obtain the values associated with a specific key.

- **Creating a Flexible Template for Data Iteration**
1. Create a template that allows you to iterate through data dynamically
2. This template should have the flexibility to accept either headerMap or formMetaData. This approach will enhance code reusability and adaptability.
